# 4-bit-multiplier
Implementation of 4-bit Multiplier in Verilog by cascading three 4-bit adder

# Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a 4-bit binary multiplier using Verilog HDL, designed by generating partial products and cascading three 4-bit adders to compute the final 8-bit result.

# Features
1. Designed without using '*' (multiply) operator

2. Uses partial product generation and bit shifting

3. Three 4-bit adders are used in series to compute the full product

4. Written in Verilog, testbench included

# How It Works
1. Partial products are generated by AND-ing multiplicand A with each bit of multiplier B

2. These partial products are left-shifted appropriately

3. Three 4-bit adders add the shifted partial products in sequence

4. Result is assembled into an 8-bit product

# Tools Used

1. Vivado (by Xilinx):
For writing, synthesizing and simulating Verilog HDL modules.

2. QUCS (Quite Universal Circuit Simulator):
Used for logic verification and circuit analysis in a user-friendly schematic environment.

# Applications
1. Used in ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) of processors

2. Core operation in DSP (Digital Signal Processing)

3. Helpful for FPGA and ASIC design learners

4. Foundation for custom VLSI multiplier units
